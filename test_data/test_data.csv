If you are suggesting that I am some kind of PR person for the DND, your badly mistaking, else I wouldn't be putting the CADPAT on the home page, nor would I have translated the article for the french language wikipedia.
The point, that, thankfully, you understood is that """"likely"""" and """"would have"""" are not usable on an encyclopedia entry.
